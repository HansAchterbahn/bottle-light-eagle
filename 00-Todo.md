## Schematic

* [ ] PotiLuminosity is connectet to a ADC interupt pin but not to an single ended adc -> pin musst be changed
* [ ] IC2 LF33 should be changed to a SMD device and put to bottom
* [ ] X4 USB connector should put to bottom
* [ ] S2 should be changed to a horizontal lever to decrease height
* [ ] it could be nice to add second X2 connector after the APA102 LEDs
* [ ] add a 3.3 V to 5 V driver for MOSI and SCLK
* [ ] add pins at the edges of the pcb to use them as holder in a laser-cut box
* [ ] change to a STM32F4 microcontroller to get a real random number genearator -> maybe the STM32F415RG?
* [ ] change programmer connector to FFC type
* [ ] Add an additional potentiometer to have the option of not assembling the touchpad

## Board

* [ ] the SWD Connector needs signal labeling
* [ ] it could be elegant to move S1, S2 and R26 to bottom
* [ ] footprint of APA102 is a bit to large -> change it
